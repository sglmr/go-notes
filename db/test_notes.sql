The **golden hour** (just after sunrise or before sunset) provides the most flattering light for landscapes\n2. Use a small aperture (f/11 to f/16) for greater depth of field\n3. A polarizing filter can reduce glare and enhance colors, especially useful for water and sky\n4. Consider foreground elements to create depth in the composition\n5.
